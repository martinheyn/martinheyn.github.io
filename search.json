    "text": "I’m a senior lecturer at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. My research concentrates around Software Engineering for AI and distributed cyber-physical systems. I’m especially interested in studying how we can set requirements for training data and data at runtime based on prior knowledge we have about the problem domain. A research direction that triggered my interest for achieving this aim is causal modelling and information entropy. I’m teaching the courses DIT357: Distributed Systems and DAT550 / DIT978: Advanced Software Engineering for AI/ML-Enabled Systems. I’m also giving guest lectures in DIT633: Development of Embedded and Real-Time Systems.\nOn this site I keep a list of my publications, my CV, a list of my services and a list of theses I supervise. Feel free to contact me if you have questions.\nI am on parental leave until April 2026 which is why I do not offer regular office hours at the moment. If you have a question or request regarding my research or teaching, please send me an e-mail. I will answer as soon as possible given that my little daughter allows me a moment of time :).\n\n\n\nNorwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway\nPh.D. in Marine Cybernetics | September 2014 - October 2018 | Thesis: Motion Sensing on Vessels Operating in Sea Ice.\nRWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany\nM.Sc.
