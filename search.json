    "text": "I’m a senior lecturer at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. My research concentrates around Software Engineering for AI and distributed cyber-physical systems. I’m especially interested in studying how we can set reasonable data requirements for training and run-time data and implement fault detection for AI based on runtime data. A research direction that triggered my interest for achieving these aims is causal modelling. I’m teaching the courses EDA344 / LEU062 / DIT423: Data Communication, DAT257 / DIT257: Agile Software Project Management, and DAT550 / DIT978: Advanced Software Engineering for AI/ML-Enabled Systems.\nOn this site I keep a list of my publications, my CV, a list of my services and a list of theses I supervise.
